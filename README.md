## Project Overview

This project explores various machine learning and deep learning techniques to predict diabetes using the Pima Indians Diabetes Database,
consists of several steps, including data exploration, preprocessing, model building, and evaluation. 
The main steps are as follows:

1.  **Initial Data Exploration:**
    * Loading the dataset.
    * Exploring basic information (shape, data types, null values).
    * Visualizing data distributions.

2.  **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
    * Generating correlation heatmaps.
    * Creating count plots for the target variable.
    * Generating pair plots for feature relationships.

3.  **Outlier Handling:**
    * Identifying and removing outliers using the IQR method.

4.  **Linear Regression:**
    * Predicting `DiabetesPedigreeFunction` using linear regression.
    * Evaluating the model using MSE and R-squared.
    * Analyzing residuals.

5.  **Classification Models:**
    * Training and evaluating various classification models:
        * Logistic Regression
        * Support Vector Machine (SVM)
        * K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
        * Random Forest
        * Gaussian Naive Bayes
        * Gradient Boosting
    * Evaluating models using accuracy, ROC AUC, and cross-validation.

6.  **Model Visualization:**
    * Comparing model performance using bar plots for accuracy and ROC AUC.

7.  **Clustering:**
    * Performing K-Means clustering to group data points.
    * Evaluating clustering using the silhouette score.

8.  **Deep Learning:**
    * Building a deep learning model using TensorFlow.
    * Training and evaluating the model.
